    <p> My hobby is playing the keyboard (in my free time of course). In alternate days, I have a music class from 6:30 to 7:30 pm that is based entirely on piano skills. I am 10 years old. Music is melodious and makes you feel good. This hobby can be developed by anyone who is a music enthusiast. Music is a source of peace, happiness etc. </p>
